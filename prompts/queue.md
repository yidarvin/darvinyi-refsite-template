# Run Queue

Run order, top to bottom. The **next** item is the first `PENDING` row. Statuses:
`PENDING`, `DONE`, `SKIPPED`. Update the status cell after each run. Reorder by
moving rows. Adding a chapter means adding a `PENDING` row here and a matching
entry in `content/registry.json`. See `CLAUDE.md` for the trigger phrases and the
`refsite-runner` skill for the per-item procedure.

| #  | slug                     | item                          | status  |
|----|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 00 | how-this-book-is-built   | How this book is built        | DONE    |
| 01 | the-first-real-chapter   | Your first real chapter       | PENDING |

<!--
To seed a real book: replace the title/subtitle in content/registry.json, then add
one PENDING row per chapter here (and a matching registry entry) in reading order.
Then say "run the next one". In graph mode (a survey that follows citations), a run
appends newly discovered items to the bottom of this table with a source note.
