# CLAUDE.md

This repo is a **queue-built reference site**: a Vite + React + TypeScript + MDX
site deployed on Vercel, where each chapter is researched, built, and critiqued
one at a time from a queue. This file is deliberately thin. The procedure lives
in a skill so it stays consistent across every site of this kind.

## Use the refsite-runner skill

The build loop, the critique loop, the queue verbs, the house style, and the
definition of done all live in the **`refsite-runner`** skill (installed at
`~/.claude/skills/refsite-runner/`, source: github.com/yidarvin/darvinyi-refsite-runner-skill).
When I say **"run the next one"**, **"run
the next N"**, **"critique the next one"**, **"resolve critiques"**, **"queue
status"**, **"add X"**, **"reprioritize"**, or **"rerun <slug>"**, follow that
skill.

If the skill is not installed, tell me before improvising.

## Where things live in this repo

- `prompts/queue.md` --- the ordered run list. The next item is the first PENDING row.
- `content/registry.json` --- the database. Which chapters exist, their order, status.
- `content/critiques/<slug>.md` --- one file per built chapter, append-only. Line 1
  is the verdict (`approve` | `revise` | `resolved`); everything below is the
  round-by-round review history.
- `src/chapters/<slug>.mdx` --- chapter prose. Bespoke figures and the signature
  widget go under `src/chapters/_figures/` and `src/chapters/_widgets/`.
- `src/styles/tokens.css` --- the running house style. Treat it as source of truth.
- `src/components/` --- shared primitives: Figure, Widget, ExerciseCard, Callout.
- `prompts/critique-rubric.md` --- the per-site rubric the critic reads on top of
  the skill's generic critique doctrine.
- `run.sh` --- the stage driver: `next | loop [N] | status | build | critique`.
- `scripts/` --- the repo-owned tooling the skill calls: `validate.py`,
  `prose_lint.py`, `new_chapter.py`, `mark.py`, `decide.py`, `check.sh`,
  `sitemap.mjs`.

## House rules

- Match the existing house style exactly. Prose has no em dashes and none of the
  usual AI tells (see the skill's authoring spec).
- Never auto-commit to `main` and push, and never deploy, unless I say so. End each
  run with a summary and let me review with `npm run dev`.
- `npm run check` is the entire definition of mechanical done. A run may not mark an
  item DONE unless it passes.
- A chapter is DONE only once a critique on file says `verdict: approve`. A build
  stops at DRAFT; done is the critic's to give, and `npm run check` enforces it.
